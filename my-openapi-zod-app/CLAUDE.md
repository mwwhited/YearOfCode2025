## Project Overview
This is a PoC project combining React + TypeScript + Zod + OpenAPI for type-safe full-stack development.

## Key Technologies
- React 19 with TypeScript
- Vite for build/dev server  
- Zod for schema validation
- openapi-zod-client for API client generation
- TanStack Table for data grids
- ESLint for code quality

## Current State
- âœ… Basic React + TypeScript setup with Vite
- âœ… OpenAPI client generation working
- âœ… GenericDataGrid component using TanStack Table
- âœ… Type-safe API calls with Zod validation
- âœ… Documentation and automation scripts created
- âœ… Reference files created for easy lookup

## Quick Reference Files
- `API_REFERENCE.md` - API endpoints, schemas, and client usage
- `COMPONENT_PATTERNS.md` - Component usage patterns and examples
- `SCRIPTS_REFERENCE.md` - All available scripts and commands
- `TESTING.md` - Testing guide and test organization
- `PIPELINE.md` - Build pipeline and CI/CD documentation
- `ISSUES_TRACKER.md` - Current issues and technical debt
- `TODO.md` - Task tracking
- `CHANGES.md` - Change log

## Development Workflow
1. Always prefer automation scripts over manual processing
2. Use TodoWrite tool for task management  
3. Update CHANGES.md for all modifications
4. Keep reference files updated
5. Check ISSUES_TRACKER.md for known problems

## Key Commands
- `npm run dev` - Start development
- `npm run generate-client` - Generate API client
- `npm run check-types` - Full validation suite

## Status
ðŸŽ‰ **FULLY COMPLETE** - All todo items implemented successfully:
- âœ… Enhanced build pipeline with quality gates
- âœ… GitHub Actions CI/CD with coverage reporting
- âœ… Pre-commit hooks with lint-staged validation
- âœ… Deployment pipeline for staging/production
- âœ… Coverage thresholds (70%) and comprehensive reporting
- âœ… Security audit integration
- âœ… React Error Boundaries with recovery functionality
- âœ… Advanced data grid with sorting, filtering, and search
- âœ… Generic form components with Zod validation
- âœ… Comprehensive monitoring system with dashboard
- âœ… End-to-end testing with Playwright
- âœ… Interactive demo page showcasing all features

## Available Commands
- `npm run build:pipeline` - Enhanced build with quality checks
- `npm run deploy:staging` - Deploy to staging
