## Project Overview
This is a PoC project combining React + TypeScript + Zod + OpenAPI for type-safe full-stack development.

## Key Technologies
- React 19 with TypeScript
- Vite for build/dev server  
- Zod for schema validation
- openapi-zod-client for API client generation
- TanStack Table for data grids
- ESLint for code quality

## Current State
- âœ… Basic React + TypeScript setup with Vite
- âœ… OpenAPI client generation working
- âœ… GenericDataGrid component using TanStack Table
- âœ… Type-safe API calls with Zod validation
- âœ… Documentation and automation scripts created
- âœ… Reference files created for easy lookup

## Quick Reference Files
- `API_REFERENCE.md` - API endpoints, schemas, and client usage
- `COMPONENT_PATTERNS.md` - Component usage patterns and examples
- `SCRIPTS_REFERENCE.md` - All available scripts and commands
- `TESTING.md` - Testing guide and test organization
- `PIPELINE.md` - Build pipeline and CI/CD documentation
- `ISSUES_TRACKER.md` - Current issues and technical debt
- `TODO.md` - Task tracking
- `CHANGES.md` - Change log

## Development Workflow
1. Always prefer automation scripts over manual processing
2. Use TodoWrite tool for task management  
3. Update CHANGES.md for all modifications
4. Keep reference files updated
5. Check ISSUES_TRACKER.md for known problems

## Key Commands
- `npm run dev` - Start development
- `npm run generate-client` - Generate API client
- `npm run check-types` - Full validation suite

## Status
ðŸŽ‰ **PRODUCTION-READY** - Complete build pipeline and CI/CD implementation:
- âœ… Enhanced build pipeline with quality gates
- âœ… GitHub Actions CI/CD with coverage reporting
- âœ… Pre-commit hooks with lint-staged validation
- âœ… Deployment pipeline for staging/production
- âœ… Coverage thresholds (70%) and comprehensive reporting
- âœ… Security audit integration
- âœ… Automated build size and coverage PR comments
- âœ… Multi-environment deployment workflows

## Pipeline Commands
- `npm run build:pipeline` - Enhanced build with quality checks
- `npm run deploy:staging` - Deploy to staging
- `npm run deploy:production` - Deploy to production
- `npm run test:coverage` - Generate coverage reports

## Next Potential Enhancements
- Add React Error Boundaries
- Implement table sorting/filtering
- Add more API endpoints and forms
- Set up monitoring and alerting
