## Notes üìù

- Generated API client files are ignored in ESLint configuration
- Application uses PrimeReact Saga Blue theme
- CSS variables are centralized in `src/styles/variables.css`
- Role-based routing is implemented with ProtectedRoute component
- Deep linking is supported through React Router
- **Runtime Configuration**: App now uses `public/config.json` for all settings
- **Post-Build Config**: Configuration can be changed without rebuilding
- **Environment Flexibility**: Single build works across all environments
