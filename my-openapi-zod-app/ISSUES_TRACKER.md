# Issues Tracker

## Current Issues

### Low Priority
- **Limited Error Boundaries** 
  - Only basic error handling, no React Error Boundaries
  - Could improve error UX further

- **GenericDataGrid Enhancements**
  - No sorting, filtering, or pagination
  - Could add more advanced table features
  - No column customization options

- **Test Coverage**
  - Basic component tests only
  - Missing integration tests for API calls
  - No coverage reporting configured

## Resolved Issues
- ✅ **useEffect Infinite Loop** - Fixed dependency array issue
- ✅ **Missing Error Handling** - Added comprehensive try/catch with error states
- ✅ **GenericDataGrid Type Inference** - Improved with constrained generics
- ✅ **No Loading States** - Added loading indicators
- ✅ **Missing Tests** - Created unit tests for components
- ✅ **No automation scripts** - Created script files
- ✅ **Missing documentation** - Created README.md
- ✅ **No package.json script commands** - Added new scripts
- ✅ **Commented code cleanup** - Removed all commented code
- ✅ **TypeScript/ESLint errors** - Fixed all compilation and linting issues

## Technical Debt
- Consider adding React Error Boundaries for better error handling
- Add proper logging/monitoring
- Consider adding state management (Redux/Zustand) for larger scale
- Add API response caching
- Consider adding form validation with Zod
- Add end-to-end tests with Playwright/Cypress
