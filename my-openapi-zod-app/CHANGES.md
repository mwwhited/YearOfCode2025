  - `dev-setup` - Runs dev-setup.sh  
  - `check-types` - Runs check-types.sh
  - `typecheck` - Quick TypeScript compilation check

### Identified Issues
- useEffect in App.tsx lacks dependency array (causes infinite re-renders)
- Missing error handling for API calls
- GenericDataGrid schema parameter type inference could be improved
- No loading states in the application
- Missing unit tests

### Fixed Issues
- ✅ Fixed useEffect dependency array issue (prevents infinite re-renders)
- ✅ Added comprehensive error handling for API calls
- ✅ Added loading states to improve UX
- ✅ Improved GenericDataGrid type inference with better generics
- ✅ Added unit tests for components
- ✅ Fixed schema parameter in GenericDataGrid usage
- ✅ Moved API client creation inside useEffect to fix dependency warning
- ✅ Cleaned up commented code in App.tsx
- ✅ Added proper table styling to GenericDataGrid
- ✅ Added test infrastructure with Vitest and Testing Library

### Technical Improvements
- Enhanced GenericDataGrid with better type safety using constrained generics
- Added proper cell rendering with null/undefined handling
- Improved table styling with responsive design
- Created comprehensive test suite with mocking
- Added test scripts to package.json
- Fixed all TypeScript and ESLint errors

### Tests Added
- GenericDataGrid component tests (4 test cases)
- App component tests (4 test cases)
- All tests passing with proper mocking

### Test Organization System
- ✅ Implemented test tagging system for category-based test running
- ✅ Added support for `unit`, `integration`, `devtool`, `component`, and `api` test categories
- ✅ Created comprehensive test scripts for different test types
- ✅ Added watch mode for specific test categories
- ✅ Created `TESTING.md` documentation with testing guide

### Test Categories Created
- **Unit Tests**: 8 tests (App + GenericDataGrid components)
- **Integration Tests**: 3 tests (API client integration)
- **Development Tool Tests**: 4 tests (Schema validation, debugging)
- **Component Tests**: 8 tests (React component testing)
- **API Tests**: 3 tests (API client functionality)

### Test Commands Available
- `npm run test:unit` - Run unit tests only
- `npm run test:integration` - Run integration tests only
- `npm run test:devtool` - Run development tool tests only
- `npm run test:component` - Run component tests only  
- `npm run test:api` - Run API tests only
- `npm run test:watch:unit` - Watch unit tests
- `npm run test:watch:integration` - Watch integration tests

### Refactoring Automation Scripts
- ✅ Created `organize-tests.sh` - Automates test organization and tagging
- ✅ Created `refactor-components.sh` - Automates component refactoring tasks
- ✅ Added refactoring scripts to package.json
- ✅ Updated SCRIPTS_REFERENCE.md with new automation tools

### Script Capabilities
- **organize-tests.sh**: Tag tests, validate structure, create test scripts
- **refactor-components.sh**: Improve type safety, add error boundaries, create tests
- **Automated workflows**: Reduces manual file editing and context usage
- **Reusable patterns**: Scripts can be run multiple times for different components

### Build Pipeline & CI/CD Implementation
- ✅ Created comprehensive build pipeline script (`build-pipeline.sh`)
- ✅ Implemented GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline with multiple jobs
- ✅ Added pre-commit hooks with lint-staged and husky
- ✅ Created deployment pipeline script for staging/production
- ✅ Added coverage thresholds and reporting (70% minimum)
- ✅ Implemented security audit integration
- ✅ Added build size reporting and PR comments

### Pipeline Features
- **Quality Gates**: TypeScript, ESLint, tests, coverage, security
- **Multi-Environment**: Staging and production deployments
- **Automated Reporting**: Build size, coverage, and deployment reports
- **Git Hooks**: Pre-commit (lint-staged) and pre-push (full validation)
- **Coverage**: HTML, JSON, LCOV reports with 70% thresholds
- **Security**: NPM audit integration with configurable levels

### Available Pipeline Commands
- `npm run build:pipeline` - Enhanced build with quality checks
- `npm run deploy:staging` - Deploy to staging environment
- `npm run deploy:production` - Deploy to production environment
- `npm run test:coverage` - Generate coverage reports
